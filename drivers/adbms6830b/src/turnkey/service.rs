//! Service for ADBMS6830B.

// u_TODO for tomorrow: 
// add a diagnostic for the entire configA register maybe. just to be sure.
// also add detect_num_chips diagnostics for each line just because it would be interesting to see
// maybe even add a .start() flag and a .pause() flag for the service so the sleep recovery stuff can actually be tested, and maybe even low power/sleeo mode could be used if gaf
