    /// ### Syntax
    /// ```ignore
    /// impl_readcode!(
    ///     /// Doc comment for the enum itself.
    ///     MyReadCode,
    ///     /// Doc comment for a documented code.
    ///     SomeVariant = 0b0110,
    ///     /// Doc comment for the Unknown.
    ///     Unknown(u8),
    ///     default = Self::Unknown(0b1000)
    /// );
    /// ```
    ///
    /// ### Parameters
    /// - `$name`: the name of the enum to declare. It is always declared `pub` and derives
    ///   `Copy, Clone, Debug, PartialEq, Eq`.
    /// - `$variant = $code`: the documented codes as laid out in the datasheet Tables 33-35. Codes not specified here
    ///   will become `Unknown`.
    /// - `Unknown(u8),`: written out explicitly so the variant can carry its own doc comment. The literal
    ///   `Unknown(u8),` is what terminates the variant list.
    /// - `default = ...`: the value used by `DEFAULT`/`Default`. Should be code that isn't documented for that
    ///   field, so that the default resolves to an `Unknown` instead of decoding as a real code.
    ///
    /// ### Why this is a tt-muncher
    /// A rule can't contain two adjacent `$(#[$m:meta])*` repetitions because at a `#[doc]` token the matcher can't tell whether it belongs to the current
    /// variant or to the trailing `Unknown` variant, and rejects the macro with a local ambiguity error.
    /// Munching one variant at a time fixes that since separate rules are attempted in order.
